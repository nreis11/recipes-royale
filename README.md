### Mock Client Project Prompt:

A chef wants to open a new restaurant! Her niche is that she wants to crowdsource her menu and change it each week. To do this she has made a call to all her friends on social media channels. " Bring me your best recipe, I'll give you 10% of the profits per dish sold, and give the person you wish credit for the meal." Emails started pouring in by the thousands so much so that she is unable to keep track of all of them. She has hired DBC to help her! Your task is to create a recipe collection application that users can sign up for and submit their favorite in each category. The requirements are as follows.

MVP:
A user should be able to log into the app.
A user should be able to submit a SINGLE recipe to a category:
* Appetizer
* Salad
* Main Course
* Dessert

A recipe should consist of a name, ingredients, difficulty level, prep time, directions, and creator.
Each Ingredient consists of the item, the amount, and the measurement

Nice to have:
Users can Rate a recipe a single time 1-5 stars
